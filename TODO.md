This project was for April Fools' 2024, so getting these done wasn't really important, they were more of a nice idea.  
I will accept pull requests for any community updates that fix bugs.  

- Mysterious Armour Trim Material ideally should fade from purple to orange like the gem counterpart, however trim_materials don't currently support this and I didn't have time to add this myself.  
  - At the moment it's a mix of the purple and orange to make a pinkish colour.  
- `Think of the Villagers!` advancement should ideally be granted when the player is near a exchanger when it exchanges. (#1)  
  - I've made it grant when it is placed as I don't have the time for custom criterions.  
- Ideally the portal to/from the ancientworld dimension would use the custom portal api (https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:custom_portals) or something simular that supports horizontal portals.  
  - This wasn't avaliable for snapshots.
- Beds don't actually work in ancientworld.
  - The time in overworld and ancientworld preferrably would be linked allowing for players to sleep to pass the time in both.  
- The portal room should really be underground however blocks generate inside of it even though they should be air.

If updating to a non-potato verison, use this branch.
